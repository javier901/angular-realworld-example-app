# How it works

We're currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but the codebase should be straightforward to follow as is. 

### Making requests to the backend API
If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and change `api_url` to the local server's URL (i.e. `localhost:3000/api`)


# Getting started

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Functionality overview

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)

    - Authentication can be easily switched to session/cookie based
